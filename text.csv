Initially farmers only got 20-30% of the market price of the crop with the middlemen pocketing the rest.Therefore, even a 20% increase in productivity by more efficient practices and modern methods resulted in only an effective benefit of 4 – 8 % to the farmer. Other methods lacked sustainability as they either depended on subsidies, or were designed for large scale farmers and not for small homesteads. Hence, the
challenge remained to improve the peasants condition in a sustainable and substantial manner.

As part of the IT implementation strategy, the Government of Kerala had entrusted the National Informatics Centre (NIC) with the design, development and implementation of treasury computerisation. With this aim in mind, NIC has designed, developed and implemented the TIS. The treasury computerisation project is one of the major e-governance projects of the Government of Kerala developed by the NIC. As a second step towards IT, the data stored in individual treasuries has to be brought to a central data server on a daily basis, where these details will be combined together to generate valuable information needed for the effective financial management of the state. The Finance Department, Government of Kerala, has felt the need to have a centralised and integrated mechanism for monitoring and maintaining the financial position of the state. NIC has designed an architecture solution to address the requirements of the department. It has proposed an integrated, comprehensive state-of-art solution called TRIM (TReasury Information Management). TRIM is conceptualised as a web-enabled application supporting ‘e–financial management’.  
TRIM is designed and developed as a centralised repository of treasury transactions and related data to provide (government-to-government) G2G and (government-to-citizen) G2C services. Payment and receipt transactions taking place in all the treasuries are brought to the Data Centre at the Directorate of Treasuries through the TIS (Treasury Information System) application on a daily basis through a dial-up network. Apart from maintaining individual transactions, the TRIM system upholds treasury-wise, date-wise, head-ofaccount-wise summary details for effective and fast information delivery. e-Government and citizen services are provided through the treasury portal http://treasury.kerala.gov.in.";19/01/2006; http://keralatreasuries.gov.in;Self-Financed Initiative;>5;Finance People;Citizen;Decision making government;"Number of Transactions per year : 96,00,000

They are spread over the Arabian Sea at a distance of 150 to 420 km away from the mainland, and are geographically isolated (Fig. 1).The distance between the islands is about 65 to 400 km. The geographic isolation of the islands makes each island virtually a territory by itself requiring all the basic amenities on the island itself. However, facilities like hospitals, educational institutions, employment exchanges, regional transport offices, etc., are only available either at the capital island, Kavaratti, or on the mainland. So, each and every person in the islands has to depend on the ship service for one or the other reason. In short, the ship service is the lifeline of the Lakahdweep Islands, and the lives of these people depend on the schedule of a ship or the availability of a ticket on a ship.
The project envisages the implementation of ‘anywhere to anywhere’ ship ticket advance reservation system from anywhere for passengers and cargo ships of the Lakshadweep Administration. The project also aims at improving transparency and bringing accountability to the ticketing process and providing citizen services to the rural masses living in these remote and geographically isolated islands. The connectivity to the islands is achieved through state-of-the-art VSAT network as an extension of NICNET. The software was designed and developed using Microsoft.NET technologies. Ship schedules, ticket availability and ticket status are available through the internet, and a ship ticket availability display system is also introduced in all locations to ensure transparency of the system.

Service Users’ Feedback Mechanism • As and whenever official/casual meeting of officers is arranged, oral feedbacks are collected. • A quarterly e-Procurement feedback form is sent to all the users (Department and Suppliers/contractors, etc.,) for their inputs on the functionality and operational aspects of the e-Procurement system • A monthly feedback form focusing on number and value of tenders mainly is also sent to the departments. 17. Implementation Challenges • Business Model : One of the major tasks for the implementation of the project was to select the business model for e-Procurement project. After a series of meetings and discussions, it was decided to adopt the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model wherein, the technology, finance and risk involved shall be taken care of by the Private partner. • Confidentiality & Security : For success of the project, it was necessary that all stakeholders were taken into confidence w.r.t. the transactions being handled by the e-Procurement system. The usage of PKI enabled DSC along with the normal user-ID and password at critical stages was hence introduced for utmost Confidentiality & Security of bidding process along with other security parameters like Audit trails, data encryption, disaster recovery, etc. • Departmental Coordination : Owing to the wide spread reach of the project it was necessary to have coordination within and outside the departments. In order to achieve the same, Nodal officers were appointed who shall coordinate and expedite the e-Procurement activities within and outside the departments. e-PROCUREMENT 525 • Adoption & Change of Mindset : One of the most important challenges faced was the adoption of e-Procurement system by the departments and changing the mindset & attitude from the existing manual working system to electronic working system • Availability of IT infrastructure : For smooth functioning of the e-Procurement project, the Application Service Provider (ASP) of e-Procurement system is to provide 200 desktops which shall be deployed at locations, as specified by the department and approved by the Project Director, for smooth functioning for the project • To make aware the very large heterogeneous mass of bidders was also a big challenge. Awareness campaign was launched to cope up with it • Resistance to change by the contractors and Government Officials alike. 18. Key Lessons Learnt • PPP Model : A project to run on the PPP business model which has helped in scaling the various stages of project operations • Change Agents : The constitution of Task Force Committee with the Secretary—PWD as the Chairman and Head of pilot Departments (HoD) as its member has acted as change agents in implementation of the project • Knowledge Sharing : The awareness and training sessions conducted had helped in understanding the user and the suppliers of service requirements better in order to incorporate the necessary changes in the system • Political Ownership: Direct support of Political Executives is very critical for success of the project.

Goals and Objectives The objective of this project is to use digital workflow as the norm of operation within Government and thereby, realizing the benefits of efficiency, productivity, speedier transactions and service delivery at lower costs. The project also demonstrates that the paperless operations can be effectively used in the public sector to reduce paper use and provide better services to its clients and citizens. A digital document management system allows the citizens to know the status of their files through web and mobile interface. The integrated digital file flow management system makes the governance transparent, faster and more efficient. The biggest beneficiaries of the project are implementing organizations themselves as the implementation has led to higher efficiency and increased productivity. The employees benefit as the drudgery of maintaining paper files and their movement is reduced, retrieving of files and information becomes easier and anywhere anytime access is enabled. The employees also benefit as paperless office leads to better working ambience. The public all over Kerala are the beneficiaries of the project as the new system paves way for faster and efficient file movement and speedy redressal of grievances. Besides, they can access details of their petitions through Internet improving service delivery. The application being used for digital workflow in the Government of Kerala is MESSAGE. Developed in an open-source by the National Informatics Center (NIC), the MESSAGE system provides an efficient monitoring and control of files and effective internal and external information exchange. It helps in the development of an effective knowledge base, content and document management THIRTY NINE Digital Workflow using MESSAGE in Government of Kerala Kala K DIGITAL WORKFLOW USING MESSAGE IN... 527 system which in turn will provide a quick access to information. It also enables use of local language—Malayalam—in the workflow. With the advent of the system, the records are maintained in a better way as electronic files and it helps to create a less paper office with a better and neat working ambience. At present the system is operational at Kerala State IT Mission, Akshaya Directorate and all district offices of Akshaya, Kerala State Urban Development Programme and Kerala State IT Infrastructure Ltd. Recently, the Government has introduced the system in six Departments of the Secretariat, namely: Higher Education, Public Works, Finance, Food & Civil Supplies, Information Technology and the Department of non-Resident Keralites Affairs. All petitions received from MLAs, MPs, common people will be handled on through the digital workflow system in the Secretariat. The project envisages drawing all secretariat departments to this integrated file flow system. 2. Spread of Project Service Users The biggest beneficiaries of the project are implementing organizations themselves as the implementation has led to higher efficiency and increased productivity. The employees benefit as the drudgery of maintaining paper files and their movement is reduced, retrieving of files and information becomes easier and anywhere anytime access is enabled. The employees also benefit as paperless office leads to better working ambience. The public all over Kerala are the beneficiaries of the project as the new system paves way for faster and efficient file movement and speedy redressal of grievances. Besides, they can access details of their petitions through Internet improving service delivery. 3. Services Provided The digital file flow through MESSAGE automatically establishes a network-based system to monitor the flow of electronic files. The files/tapals are captured at source and the movements are tracked across the office. Thus, the use of MESSAGE provides for an efficient and transparent administration, efficient monitoring and control, effective internal and external information exchange, building knowledge bases, content and document management systems and robust decisions support systems; it also paves way for a structured workflow environment and helps in an effective policy-making and improves service delivery systems. 528 TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT: e-GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES IN INDIA 528 The paperless working through digital workflow is primarily a G2E project with spillover benefits to citizens. • G2E benefits in terms of ease of working, better ambience, anytime, anywhere access of files, easy search and retrieval are some of the direct benefits which accrue to employees. • From the organization perspective, improved productivity and efficiency, reduced costs are direct benefits. The ability to handle growth in activities is a consequence of the increased productivity of employees. Being paperless, saves the respective organization lakhs of rupees per annum in terms of paper costs, printing costs, filing costs and postage. Moreover, there is saving in terms of maintenance costs, reduction in space requirement for safe-keeping of paper records and files, which is in addition to the direct savings. Since employees use electronic files, the digital file flow has reduced the time taken in file movement. File tracking, retrieval and access have become far easier, enabling each officer to handle larger number of files. • The system also provides significant G2C services. In the manual system, to know the status of a file or a complaint, the citizen was forced to contact multiple sections/seats. After the introduction of the digital workflow the citizens need not approach multiple points. The feature available in digital workflow helps the citizen know the file status through Internet from anywhere at anytime. This ensures transparency in administration. • The implementation of the system has resulted in more space all around. The working ambience of employees has improved, as heaps of papers and piles of file folders have gone and the desk primarily consists of a computer and a scanner. No new filing cabinets/almirahs had to be procured. • Another important service provided by the system is document security. There is no threat to lose important documents due to theft, fire or other disasters as such. The server for the system was hosted in a State Data Center which is a tier III facility and provides very high standard of security and availability. The users were required to follow standard security practices at the client side. • Ability to handle growth of e-governance activities in the state: There is explosion of e-governance activities in the State. Being the nodal Department for all e-governance activities of all Government Departments DIGITAL WORKFLOW USING MESSAGE IN... 529 and organizations, KSITM needed to grow very fast. Digital workflow has enabled employees to work more efficiently. Their productivity has increased manifold. For example, before the introduction of the system, KSITM with the same staff strength was handling about 15 projects. Presently, it is handling over 30 projects. The details of these projects are available at www.keralaitmission.org. While it may be inaccurate to attribute this change solely to the implementation of digital workflow and paperless operations, nevertheless, we feel that the increased efficiency has been largely due to the new system. • Access from anywhere anytime enables employees to attend to files from home or when on travel. This further reduces time delays. • The implementation of the system is slowly resulting in accepting less paper from external agencies. In KSITM, it is common to ask the sender to send soft copy of reports and store them electronically. This has spillover effect beyond the organizational boundaries as well. Similarly, the use of system is also resulting in less paper out. There is increased dependence of sending communication electronically wherever the recipient organization is accepting such communications. Notice for holding meetings, agenda notes for meetings, drafts for comments etc., are some of the documents which form a huge proportion of paper communication in the past. These are increasingly becoming electronic. • In the long-run, paperless working is also environment-friendly. Increasing migration to paperless working also has positive impact on the prevention of deforestation and the reduction of carbon emissions as there is no need to use energy for paper production. • There are intangible benefits like improvement of self-esteem and pride among employees of working in a paperless office and serving as a role model for others. • The implementation had spillover effect to implementation of other productivity tools in the organization. The SPARK was introduced for personnel management and the accounts were also increasingly computerized. 530 TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT: e-GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES IN INDIA 530 4. Geographical Spread of Project Implementation The digital workflow has already been adopted in the following organizations: Kerala State IT Mission (KSITM) in its headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram and and its office in Kochi, Akshaya Directorate and all district offices of Akshaya, Kerala State Urban Development Programme and Kerala State IT Infrastructure Ltd. Recently, Government has introduced the system in six Departments of the Secretariat, namely: Higher Education, PWD, Finance, Food & Civil Supplies, Information Technology and NORKA. In addition, several other Government Departments/organizations are in various stages of studying the feasibility of converting their operations into paperless operations. 5. Project Timelines and Milestones In the conceptual phase, when the Government decided to go for a more efficient, integrated file flow system, it approached NIC for developing a software. After developing the software, the project was first implemented in Kerala State IT Mission with effect from January 1, 2008. After trial run, it was formally inaugurated by Shri V. S. Achuthanandan, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Kerala on February 15, 2008. The top leadership in KSITM drove its implementation. Necessary back-up policy was put in place so that, records created were available for future reference. All paper-files were closed on their extant positions, and continued as electronic files. The Hon’ble Chief Minister himself took the initiative to get the implementation of the system in the Secretariat. Later in March, KSUDP also decided to implement the system in their department. At present, the system is operational at KSITM, Akshaya Di rectorate and all d istrict offices of Akshaya, K erala State Urban Development Programme and Kerala State IT Infrastructure Ltd. The project envisages drawing all Secretariat departments to this integrated file flow system within one year. Recently, the Government has introduced the system in six Departments of the Secretariat, namely: Higher Education, PWD, Finance, Food & Civil Supplies, Information Technology and NORKA. Apart from these, all petitions received from MLAs/MPs/common people will be handled on MESSAGE. DIGITAL WORKFLOW USING MESSAGE IN... 531 6. Direct Cost and Time Savings to Avail Services Message and the concept of integrated file flow provided the facility for easy administration and speedy redressal of grievances. With the upgradation of the software, the public will be provided with various service access points—SMS (mobile telephone), touch screen kiosks, Internet, Akshaya etc. So, they need not go personally to the departments concerned to know the details on file status. Thus, they can save the cost and time, which will be otherwise spent on travelling. This easy access makes the governance more transparent and efficient. 7. Direct Time Savings to Deliver Services • In the manual system, it was taking lot of time to move the files to the next section and for higher officials’ approval. For want of a peon’s service, a file may be waiting for hours/days together in a particular table without moving to the next table. It took at least one day for an employee to act on a file. But with the introduction of the integrated digital file flow management system, the time taken to act upon a file has got drastically reduced to minutes. • In the new system, the employees will be saved from the duty of filing/binding/putting paper clips/putting paper flags etc. They need not go for repeat typing for draft and fair copies. There is no need to make multiple copies of meeting notices/circulars and to maintain a personal register. All the files can be sent to the record room with just one click. Searching back-files is made easy by the ‘Search’ facility of this system. The facilities provided by MESSAGE thus save money, time and human resource of the departments. The new system also enables the officials to work from anywhere at anytime, thus making the maximum utilization of available human resources. As the departments are using the already available network infrastructure and computer, there is no extra cost except for the scanners. • The benefits in terms of time and cost can be best manifested with the example of KSITM. KSITM is a twenty-five employee’s organization. Being paperless saves it about Rs.2.5 lakhs per annum in paper costs, printing costs, filing costs, postage. This is considerable considering that the total establishment charges for KSITM are about Rs.1 crore per annum. Moreover, there is saving in terms of maintenance costs, reduction in 532 TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT: e-GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES IN INDIA 532 space requirement for safe-keeping of paper records and files, which is in addition to direct savings. Other organizations which have switched over to digital workflow will have similar figures to report in future. Since employees use electronic files, the digital file flow has reduced the time taken in file movement. File tracking, retrieval and access have become far easier, enabling each officer to handle larger number of files. Before the introduction of the system, KSITM with the same staff strength was handling about 15 projects. Presently, it is handling over 30 projects. The details of these projects are available at www.keralaitmission.org. 8. Replication The model, first implemented in KSITM was later replicated in many organizations as stated earlier. The MESSAGE can be replicated in all offices to make the file flow faster and smoother. This Government initiative may become a model for the other states to follow. 9. Implementation Model This is a Government-owned project implemented by Kerala State IT Mission. The technical support is provided by NIC. 10. Technologies The application used for the digital workflow system called MESSAGE, is open source based. It has been developed and supported by NIC. Being an open source it provides opportunities for continuous upgrades for the system without additional proprietary costs and issues of intellectual property. It therefore, provides clear opportunities for scalability. It has been developed on a three tier architecture. • E-Services layer is the front-end layer of MESSAGE which interacts with citizens and offer services to the citizens. • Middle layer is the Intranet Services layer, which offers lot of collaboration services and tools. E-Mail, Messaging, bulletin boards are few worth mentioning. • Backend layer is the key functional area comprising all functional modules along with the database.

Financial transactions and its monitoring are a vital part of every government department.
The departments mainly collect inputs from lower-level offices and derive the expenditure incurred and funds availability. The majority of these transactions are done through treasuries and PAOs – all of who have computerised their operations and connected to GSWAN. This has provided the opportunity to disseminate information to each office and its head office simultaneously. Initially, it started with the online status and voucher information for each bill. Now, data from all treasuries and PAOs are compiled at the state data centre on a daily basis, and consolidated statements are generated at each level. SWIFT ha become a reality now. The application is only a data retrieval system (URL: http://intranet.guj.nic.in/swift; related online bill and voucher information URL: http://intranet.guj.nic.in/treasury).

Jan Seva Kendra has a barcode-aided tracking system to trace and to ensure the correct order of processing of applications. The usage of technology in forms like Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) and online Website allows applicants to check the status of their applications at any time. GSM Messages are sent whenever the processed papers are ready for pick-up, so that an applicant may not need to frequently check the status or visit the Jan Seva Kendra. The software at the Kendra employs a very efficient token-based queue management system. The software also tracks applications and gives well-analyzed information as reports that are automatically sent to the Collector and the department officers by email.

The services at the Kendra include a unique “Citizen ID” feature, wherein a citizen can register himself or herself and provide finger print and photo identification information. Following this registration, any documents that a citizen submits can be stored as archives and can be reused whenever he or she applies again. Registered citizens can also benefit in ways like reduced wait time at the Kendra, online application submission, enhanced security at the time of delivery, and much more.

The Kendra also offers a human touch in addition to the technological conveniences.

It has computerised the State Secretariat and Collector offices; developed various applications for offline information collection from districts; compiled the information at state level; and if required, helped in information dissemination to the government of India by e-mail or delimited data files. Applications such as the Twenty Point Programme, fortnightly godown stock information collection system, community TV sets monitoring system, CM Relief Fund accounting system (showing daily receipts of donations district-wise at the time of the Latur earthquake) are used extensively at the state level.
In the year 2002, the Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS) project was taken up to collect data of monthly expenditure and attendance of weekly labourers at various EGS works at 33 districts. The non-availability of uninterrupted connectivity constrained the EGS application to be designed as a client-server software at the district level and web-based at the state level.
At the district level, once data entry is done, files containing data in XML
tags is prepared and sent to the state server as e-mail attachments. A demon programme written in Java was used at the state server to extract data from e-mails and dynamically insert them in respective table(s) of data base at the State NIC server. The data from the data base is then presented at state headquarters on LAN by a web application.

of the early e-Governance projects of NIC in energy sector. The project was
conceived when BSEB was in search of an appropriate application software
solution, which can help in enhancing the revenue realization through
effective data management.
In the manual system, the Board had hired five to six private agencies for
preparing the bill showing the details of arrears and previous meter reading
information only. The Meter Reader (MR) goes to the consumer’s place, notes
the current meter reading, then calculates the bill on the spot with the help
of a ready-reckoner and hands it over to the consumer. The counterfoil part
of the bill is filled up with the current meter reading by the Meter Reader
and is provided to the private agency through the Division. With the help
of counterfoil payment receipts provided by the collection counters, along
with meter reading data and corrected full ledger, the private agency prepares
the fresh full ledger and the bill for further spot billing. In this process the
frequency of the Meter Reader visiting the consumer’s place to deliver the
spot bill and to take the current meter reading data takes place every two
to three months. This indicates that the bill cycle of the consumer of the
locality is 3–4 months depending on the speed of processing by the Agency.
At the Division level, the books (group of Consumers belonging to a particular
area) were distributed among the Bill Clerks to handle bill related activities/
processes along with any grievances relating to billing.";01/01/2015;Not given;Self-Financed Initiative;2;Citizens;Government;Hardware  Suppliers;;Accurately and timely energy bill preparation and distribution;Greater transparency through web based  interface;Single point monitoring of revenue collection;Manual to online book keeping;manual bills to online changes;manual to barcodes;SQL server;Windows Server;;NIC;SWAN;State Data Center (SDC);0;Yes;1 year~;Not given;Power & Energy;Power;Bihar

Finally it is also envisaged to assist the department officers in detecting the tax evasion made by the dealers using various modus-of-operandi.;01/06/2006;http://www.nic.in/projects/vatsoft-karnataka-vat-processing-system;Self-Financed Initiative;4;Tax payers;Staff of the VAT office;Management;"FY 2004-05 = 'Rs.10,335.65'

This system is helping the VAT offices in monitoring the tax collection by various means like generation of reports and notices to defaulters, missing payments, short payments and comparative tax yield analysis etc. This e-governance system has brought transparency in the VAT administration;VATSoft’ has made the availability of all taxpayers’ data to all the offices and wings of the Department for various activities like cross-verification, intelligence, audit, vigilance activities and generation of MIS reports. Utilizing these reports, the officers have started detecting the tax evasion and bogus input tax credit claims made by the taxpayers. This system is also providing numerous analysis and comparative reports based on various parameters.;VATSoft has been introduced with unique concept called automated selection of cases for audit activity and automated assignment of these cases to the officers. Automatic selection is done on a scientific and innovative mechanism, using various risk factors based on tax evasion tactics adapted by the dealer. As it is system-generated, the cases are selected without any bias. On the same line, the assignments to the officers are impartially done on round-robin rule. This has helped in building a cordial relationship between officers and the management.; The feature of Acknowledgement generation in VATSoft has brought in transparency and accountability in processing of VAT related activities. The Registration process has been designed in such a way that, one cannot have the registration number without the application being processed on the system.; E-filing system has been introduced to collect the sale and purchase invoices from the dealers electronically.

Basically, it is a government-to-government (G2G) project, except for service pensions and social security pensions, which have an interface with the citizens. This project was implemented mainly to eliminate systemic deficiencies in the manual treasury system and for the efficient management of state finances.
This project is the first of its kind in the country where the entire treasury
activity has been computerised. This is the only project where, from the time of approval of the state budget to the point of rendering accounts to the government, the entire activity can be tracked through the system. ";;http://www.csi-sigegov.org/casestudies/06_khajane.pdf;Self-Financed Initiative;10;Staff members of treasury department;Bidders;;The number of drawing officers was brought down to around 21,000 from 40,000.;"A procedure manual detailing the departmental procedures was brought out. The manual contained details about the activities of the department and the procedures followed and the various formats of reports in use. This gave a clear picture to the bidders about the expectations of the department;Though an open bidding system was followed, the participation was limited to pre-qualified ‘total solution providers’ only. The pre-qualiThough an open bidding system was followed, the participation was limited to pre-qualified ‘total solution providers’ only. The pre-qualiThough an open bidding system was followed, the participation was limited to pre-qualified ‘total solution providers’ only. The pre-qualification was carried out by the then Karnataka Government Computer Centre (present e-Governance Secretariat), which empanelled service providers under various categories after due evaluation of the capabil - ities of the firms. This helped the department in avoiding unhealthy competition and participation of incompetent firms in the bidding process. Strict pre-qualification criterion ensured that only reputed, capable and competent service providers were empanelled as service providers.Large verities of bill formats in use in the manual system were rationalised for the computer environment, and finally the number was brought down to nine standard bill formats. ";An online problem-reporting facility enables the users to report any operational, software or hardware problem to the network manage - ment centre instantaneously. This facility has gone a long way in helping the remote sites highlight the problems and seek immediate resolution from the help desk situated in NMC, Bangalore. Redundant procedures like enter - ing the bill details in multiple registers were eliminated. The validations of the bill against the budget availability, requirements regarding the provisions of financial code and treasury code, and manual of contingent expenditure will be validated by the system itself (Fig. 7). The system checks for the validations and the genuineness of the drawing officer, his or her authority to draw the money for the scheme and whether it is within the financial powers.;User friendliness of the software, simplification of processes, elimination of the drudgery of preparing and tallying the accounts has helped the easy acceptance of the system by the employees.Software has been made modular and highly user friendly.
